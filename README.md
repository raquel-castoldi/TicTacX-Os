# TicTacX-Os
By: Gail Javier, Leslie Evangelista, Raquel Fernandes Castoldi, and Zeus Estrella

## Context
We are developing a multiplayer tic-tac-toe gaming application designed for dual-player engagement on a single device.

## Decision

### Platform Selection:

We recommend developing a web-based Tic-Tac-Toe game using HTML, CSS, and React for the frontend and Python for the backend. As for the design tool, we will use Figma to design the user interface for the mobile application. 

#### Rationale:

This decision is based on the need for a responsive and interactive user interface, as well as the requirement for real-time communication between players in a multiplayer game.

### Frontend Framework:

We propose using React for the frontend to create a dynamic and interactive user interface. We will also use Figma to assist with the frontend design and prototyping. 

#### Rationale:

React provides a component-based architecture and state management, making it well-suited for creating a responsive and interactive user interface for the game. For example, React will be an excellent tool for creating individual squares on the game board, player information, and the mobile app's in-game status. 

Choosing Figma as our design program helps visualize and prepares us for the final product of our mobile app. Figma will also help guide us on how the prototype navigation would look for the outcome of the application. 

### Backend Framework: 

We recommend using Python to build the single-device local app game. 

#### Rationale:

Using Python for the backend of the mobile app game will allow a balance of ease of development and flexibility. Python also allows cross-platform compatibility if we ever wish to expand the game. The programming language is also very suitable for our 2D concept of the game. 

### Responsive Design 

The program that we will be using for the responsive design will be CSS. 

#### Rationale: 

Using CSS for responsive design ensures the game is accessible for each component for each framework within the app. 

#### Conseqence:

By developing a web-based Tic-Tac-Toe game with React for the frontend and Python support for the backend, we can achieve a responsive and interactive gaming experience. The game is designed for local multiplayer functionality, allowing two players to take turns on a single device. This setup ensures a fair and engaging gameplay experience for friends and family sharing the same screen.
